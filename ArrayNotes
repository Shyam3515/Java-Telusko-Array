The array in java is an object the moment you say new KW it is an object, it will be created inside the heap memory.

Drawbacks:
	1) The size is fixed you can't change the size, then you need to create a new array of your preferred size, 
	   but which will consume more space in the memeory.
	2) When you want to search something it will traverse in between the elements for searching and inserting values
	   it will consume lot of time.
	3) There are some better features with collections that we can perform better with, other than array, but each
	   and everything has their own specificity.
